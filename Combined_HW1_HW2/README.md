CS325 HW2
Question 4 4.1 and 4.2 

My homework 1 does not work correct, so I corrected everything. This includes everything from  last week to this week. The output will have times (microseconds) for all three sorting algorithm. 

After unzip the file, use make to compile, then run ./main to see the output.
