I use c++ for this assignment. Within this assignemtn, there are two functions, one firstFit and one is bestFit. For first fit decrasing, I use sort through algorithm library and firstFit function to find the minimum bin number. 

Within this program, I use std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() before and after to calculate the running time. However, this has to be compile under c++11. 

Compile this program using: g++ -std=c++11 binpack.cpp then ./a.out
